# StepCounter
Test app with Render integration

Aliaksei Sidarau

`This is a company-wide steps leaderboard application for teams of employees: picture that all employees are grouped into teams and issued step counters. This application needs to receive and store step count increments for each team, and calculate sums.`

## Desciption
It contains a TeamStepCounterService which implements following functions:
1. Create a new counter so that steps can be accumulated for a team of one or multiple employees
2. Increment the value of a stored counter so that I can get steps counted towards my team's score
3. Get the current total steps taken by a team so that I can see how much that team have walked in total
4. List all teams and see their step counts so that I can compare my team with the others
5. List all counters in a team so that I can see how much each team member have walked
6. Add/delete teams so that I can manage teams
7. Add/delete counters so that I can manage team member's counters
